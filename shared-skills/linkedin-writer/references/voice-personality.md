The Message People Should Carry Away
Inspiration Through Building
People should feel inspired by seeing real things being built — not by motivational speeches. They should come away thinking "If he built that today, I can start building too."
Clarity on AI
They should get clarity on how to THINK with AI, not just use it. Frameworks like BMAD and DOE make AI approachable and systematic. High impact, real advantages that are translatable into any business.
Spark Action
It should move people from consuming AI content to actually building with AI. Take them away from the inertia of watching tutorials and get them to open Claude Code or n8n and start.
Reduce Overwhelm
Reduce the overwhelm that AI sometimes gives people. You don't need to learn everything — you need a framework and one tool. Start with BMAD + Claude Code and build from there.
Domain Expertise Matters
Most domain experts are actually incredibly well-positioned to leverage AI. They can automate non-value-adding tasks and focus on what they're experts at.
Signature Phrases
"Show, not tell" (referring to content philosophy — every video is a real build)
"Clarity comes from doing, not thinking about doing"
"Via negativa — strip away the noise to find the signal"
"I'm 25 and still building — no guru energy, just work"
"Shipped beats stuck"
"Direct Perceived Value — if it's not actionable in 10 minutes, cut it"
Key Misconceptions I Address
Misconception 1: AI is only for technical people
Truth: Non-technical professionals with domain expertise are ideally positioned. AI solutions become valuable when domain expertise is injected. With frameworks like BMAD democratizing the build process, professionals can build client-ready systems in weeks.
Misconception 2: You need to learn everything before starting
Truth: 30 days of focused learning, then go get your first client. You'll learn more applying than in 6 months of tutorials. The DOE Framework gives you structure from day one.
Misconception 3: Building in public requires a polished brand
Truth: Raw authenticity converts better than polished content. My viral videos (50K+ views) were unpolished founder journey stories, not production-quality content. People connect with real, not perfect.
Misconception 4: Hard work alone pays off
Truth: Hard work on HIGH-LEVERAGE activities is what pays off. Revenue actions first, every day. Via negativa — eliminate everything that doesn't directly move the needle.
Content Philosophy
Every piece of content should leave the reader thinking:
"He actually built that. It's real."
"I can do this too — he showed me exactly how."
"Let me try that one thing he demonstrated today."
NOT:
"Wow, he's so successful. Maybe someday I'll be ready to try what he's teaching."
