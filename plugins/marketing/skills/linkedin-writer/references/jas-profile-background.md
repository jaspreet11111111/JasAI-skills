## How I Want to Be Perceived

A builder who shows, not tells — using AI frameworks like BMAD and tools like Claude Code to solve real business problems every single day. Someone who left a stable corporate job to bet on himself, shares the journey raw and unfiltered, and helps professionals think with AI, not just use it.

## Introduction Statement

"Jaspreet is a software engineer turned AI automation builder who left his corporate job, launched an agency from scratch, and now teaches professionals to think with AI through real daily builds — not theory."

## What Sets Me Apart

I operate across the full AI value chain — and I show my work:

Build custom AI automation systems for real businesses (VividAutomate)
Teach professionals to think with AI using frameworks, not tutorials (QuestingAI / 10x With AI)
Create daily — YouTube videos of actual builds, not slideshows
Use what I sell — BMAD + Claude Code is my daily operating system, not something I recommend from the sidelines
Raw authenticity — I share the real journey publicly, not a highlight reel
