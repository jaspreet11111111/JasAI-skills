# JasAI Infographic Design Principles

This document teaches you how to think about design for JasAI infographics. Read this carefully and internalize these principles — they should inform every design decision you make.

---

## 1. Brand Philosophy

### Who Is JasAI?

JasAI is a personal brand built around helping people automate their work and businesses. The founder, Jaspreet Singh, creates content about AI, automation, and working smarter. The visual identity needs to feel like it comes from a real person — not a faceless corporation, not a startup trying too hard to be cool, but a knowledgeable professional who genuinely wants to help.

Think about the difference between receiving advice from a friend who happens to be an expert versus reading a corporate whitepaper. Both might contain the same information, but one feels warm and trustworthy while the other feels distant and cold. JasAI's visual identity should always feel like the former.

### The Visual Personality

**Friendly but professional.** We're approachable without being casual. Every infographic should feel like something you'd proudly share — not something that looks like it was thrown together, but also not something stiff and corporate.

**Clean but not sterile.** Minimalism is our friend, but we're not going for cold, clinical aesthetics. Our designs should feel like a well-organized workspace — everything has its place, there's breathing room, but it's warm and inviting.

**Confident but not arrogant.** Bold design choices signal confidence. Hard shadows, clear hierarchy, decisive color use. We don't hedge with soft effects or muddy colors. But we're also not trying to show off — substance over style.

**Approachable but premium.** Think about the feeling of walking into a really well-designed coffee shop. It's welcoming and comfortable, but you also sense quality in every detail — the thoughtful lighting, the carefully chosen materials, the intentional spacing. That's the energy.

### The Design Philosophy: "Clean Over Clever"

When in doubt, choose clarity. If you're torn between a clever visual metaphor that might confuse some viewers and a straightforward approach that everyone will understand, choose the straightforward one.

This doesn't mean boring. It means prioritizing comprehension. The best infographics communicate instantly — a viewer should "get it" in 2 seconds of looking. That requires ruthless clarity, not clever trickery.

**Reference point:** Think Apple keynote slides, not corporate PowerPoint. Apple slides are often just one image and a few words. They're bold, they're minimal, they're confident. They trust the audience to understand without hand-holding. That's what we're aiming for.

### The Feeling We Want

When someone sees a JasAI infographic in their feed, we want them to feel:
- "This looks professional and trustworthy"
- "This is easy to understand"
- "This is worth saving for later"
- "I want to share this"

We do NOT want them to feel:
- "This is overwhelming"
- "This looks like a template"
- "This feels corporate and cold"
- "I can't figure out what this is saying"

## 2. Content Analysis Framework

Before designing anything, you must understand what the content is actually saying — not at the surface level, but at the deepest level. Content has layers, and most mediocre infographics fail because they visualize the wrong one.

### The Four Layers of Content

Every piece of content — an essay, a post, a talk, an article — contains meaning at multiple depths. Extracting the right layer is the single most important design decision you'll make.

**Layer 1: NARRATIVE — What happened?**

Events, timelines, biography, sequences of actions. "I moved from Vizag to Bangalore." "The company went from 3 to 300 employees." "First we built the prototype, then we launched."

Narrative is the easiest layer to extract and the **worst** layer to visualize. It produces "story recap" infographics that feel like illustrated book reports. Nobody scrolling LinkedIn wants to see a timeline of someone's life. They want the MEANING of that life.

→ Almost never the right thing to visualize.

**Layer 2: THEMES — What is it about?**

Abstract topics and patterns. "Growth." "Struggle." "Identity." "Transformation." "Resilience."

Themes are slightly better than narrative but still too abstract. They lead to generic visual metaphors — a mountain for "growth," a butterfly for "transformation," a lightbulb for "ideas." These metaphors are so overused they're invisible. A viewer scrolling past a mountain metaphor feels nothing because they've seen it a thousand times.

→ Better, but leads to decoration rather than communication.

**Layer 3: CLAIMS — What does it SAY is true about the world?**

Universal truths, philosophical statements, hard-won insights that the content asserts. These are the sentences that make you stop and think "that's true" or "I've never thought of it that way."

Examples:
- "When the suffering is something you chose, you can work with it. When it's something that happened to you, it just eats you."
- "The fear of picking wrong is worse than the exhaustion of doing all of it badly."
- "Nobody told me I couldn't go this fast. So I didn't know I wasn't supposed to."

Claims are where editorial illustrations live. They're specific enough to visualize as a scene but universal enough that viewers recognize their own lives in them.

→ This is where the best editorial illustrations come from.

**Layer 4: INFORMATION — What concrete data, comparisons, or frameworks exist?**

Numbers, scorecards, before/after comparisons, checklists, step-by-step frameworks, structured data. Not abstract concepts — concrete structures that can be mapped directly to visual elements.

Examples:
- "Developer: 2 advantages (code, architecture), 4 gaps. Domain Expert: 6 advantages, 0 gaps."
- "3-item menu vs. infinite options: decision fatigue drops 70%."
- "Before automation: 3 hours/day on email. After: 20 minutes."

Information structures are where information graphics live. They transmit facts. The viewer LEARNS something in 1-2 seconds.

→ This is where the best information graphics come from.

### Which Layer to Visualize

The default instinct is to visualize Layer 1 (story) or Layer 2 (themes). Resist this.

| If the viewer should... | Visualize this layer | Output mode |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Feel** something — recognition, discomfort, inspiration | Layer 3: Claims | Editorial Illustration |
| **Learn** something — a fact, framework, comparison | Layer 4: Information | Information Graphic |
| **Both** — emotional hook + concrete takeaway | Layer 3 + Layer 4 | Hybrid |

### The Key Question

Never ask "what should we visualize?" — that question leads to decoration.

Instead ask: **"What should the viewer KNOW or FEEL after 2 seconds?"**

This single question changes everything downstream. If the answer is about feeling ("they should feel the weight of unchosen pain"), you're making an editorial illustration. If the answer is about knowing ("they should see that domain experts have 6 advantages"), you're making an information graphic.

### Identifying Layers in Real Content

When analyzing content, explicitly label what you find at each layer. Be honest about which layers are strong and weak:

```
LAYER 1 (Narrative): Weak. Personal timeline — not visualizable.
LAYER 2 (Themes): Moderate. "Persistence" and "identity" — too generic.
LAYER 3 (Claims): STRONG. "Chosen pain vs. inherited pain" — universal, visceral, cinematic.
LAYER 4 (Information): Weak. No concrete data or frameworks.
→ Recommendation: Layer 3, Editorial Illustration.
```

Sometimes content is strong at Layer 4 but weak at Layer 3, or vice versa. Some content has strong claims AND strong data. The analysis should reveal which path will produce the best visual, not force a predetermined choice.

---

## 3. Output Mode Taxonomy

"Infographic" is not one format. There are fundamentally different types of visual output, and confusing them is one of the most common causes of mediocre results. Before any visual thinking, you must know which mode you're in.

### Editorial Illustration

**When:** The content's strongest layer is Layer 3 (Claims). The viewer should FEEL something.

**What it looks like:** Cinematic scenes, surreal compositions, visual metaphors embodied as physical spaces. Art that sits with you. The scene IS the message — you don't illustrate a concept, you create a world that embodies a truth.

**Examples:**
- Two rooms sharing a wall: one cramped and consuming, one vast and empty. The dividing wall has a crack. (Chosen vs. inherited pain)
- A figure standing at a kitchen counter, staring at three jars. Behind them, a infinite warehouse of options fades into fog. (The paradox of choice)
- A person building a bridge plank by plank — standing on the last plank they placed, with nothing underneath. (Building without a map)

**Text density:** Minimal. One powerful line. Maybe a title. The image does the communicating.

**Style:** Discovered from the content's emotional register + user taste (see Style Discovery section). NOT the JasAI brand template.

**Prompt architecture:** Style anchor → emotional register → scene description → spatial composition → texture → color → text → negatives → technical specs.

### Information Graphic

**When:** The content's strongest layer is Layer 4 (Information). The viewer should LEARN something.

**What it looks like:** Scorecards, checklists, charts, comparisons, numbered frameworks. Clean, structured, data-driven. Scans in 1 second. The viewer saves it because it's useful.

**Examples:**
- Side-by-side scorecard: Developer (2 green, 4 red) vs. Domain Expert (6 green, 0 red). Winner obvious at a glance.
- 3-step numbered flow: Know the Problem → Prompt the Solution → Ship It.
- Before/after comparison: Manual process (3 hours) vs. Automated (20 minutes).

**Text density:** Moderate. Structured labels, short descriptions, exact data. Every word is planned and placed.

**Style:** JasAI brand system. Hard shadows, cream background, accent colors, Space Grotesk + Montserrat. Consistent across all info graphics for brand recognition.

**Prompt architecture:** Format declaration → information hierarchy → data visualization → exact text → brand system → density control → scanability → technical specs.

### Hybrid

**When:** The content has both a strong emotional claim (Layer 3) AND concrete supporting data (Layer 4). The viewer should feel something AND learn something.

**What it looks like:** An editorial visual with minimal data overlay. The emotional scene dominates, but a small data element anchors it in reality.

**Examples:**
- The "Two Rooms" scene with a small stat overlay: "87% of burnout comes from unchosen obligations."
- A cinematic automation visual with three key metrics floating in the scene.

**Text density:** Low. One headline, 2-3 data points. The art leads, the data supports.

**Use sparingly.** Most content is clearly one mode or the other. Hybrid only works when both layers are genuinely strong.

### The Critical Rule

Never start designing until you've decided the mode. The mode determines:
- What you extract from the content (claims vs. data structures)
- How you propose visualizations (scenes vs. data formats)
- What style system you use (discovered vs. brand)
- What prompt architecture you follow
- How you evaluate the result (feel vs. learn)

---

## 4. Style Discovery

**This section applies ONLY to Editorial Illustration and Hybrid modes.** Information Graphics always use the JasAI brand system.

### Why Style Matters Enormously

"Style" in image generation isn't decoration — it's a fundamental control surface. The difference between "clean modern illustration" and "Moebius linework meets Adult Swim interstitial aesthetic" in a prompt produces completely different outputs. Specific style references give the AI model a clear visual target. Abstract descriptors give it nothing to aim at.

The style should come from the content's emotional register, not from a default template. A raw personal essay about pain needs a different visual world than a reflective piece about finding peace. The style discovery process matches content tone to visual vocabulary.

### Style Anchor System

Style anchors are specific references — artists, movements, publications, aesthetic traditions — that reliably produce specific visual outcomes. Use these as starting points, not constraints:

| Style Anchor | Prompt Vectors | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **European editorial / Adult Swim** | "Moebius linework, [as] bumps aesthetic, vintage French magazine illustration, quiet existential surrealism" | Contemplative, philosophical, existential content. Raw personal truths. |
| **Graphic novel / comic panel** | "Bold confident linework, sequential framing, Hergé's clear line style, Chris Ware's structural precision" | Narrative-driven content, before/after transformations, sequential processes told with feeling. |
| **Risograph / analog print** | "Risograph printing aesthetic, visible paper grain, muted analog palette, slight registration imperfections, zine energy" | Warm, human, personal content. Authenticity over polish. |
| **Minimalist conceptual** | "Single powerful conceptual image, editorial illustration like a New Yorker cover, David Plunkert style" | One strong metaphor that says everything. Elegant simplicity. |
| **Vintage science / technical** | "Vintage scientific illustration, detailed cross-section diagrams, elegant hand-drawn technical precision" | Analytical content about how things work, system breakdowns, deep explanations. |

### Emotional Register Matching

The content's emotional register should drive style selection:

| Content Tone | Style Direction | Why |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| Raw, painful, visceral | European editorial / Adult Swim | Surreal distortion matches internal emotional states |
| Reflective, contemplative, searching | Minimalist conceptual | Silence and space mirror the thinking process |
| Warm, human, imperfect | Risograph / analog | The tactile imperfections feel authentic |
| Bold, confident, declarative | Graphic novel | Strong linework matches strong statements |
| Analytical, precise, structured | Vintage science / technical | Precision visual language for precision thinking |

### User Style Discovery

Always ask the user about style for editorial work. Present the options from the table above, but be ready for users to describe something completely different — and use their description. The style anchor table is a starting vocabulary, not a complete list.

If a user says "I want something that feels like walking through a dream" — that's a valid style direction. Translate it into specific prompt vectors: "dreamlike spatial distortion, soft focus transitions between elements, objects that shouldn't coexist sharing the same space naturally, the emotional logic of dreams rather than physical logic."

## 5. The Hard Shadow Signature

### What Is a Hard Shadow?

A hard shadow is a shadow with zero blur. The edges are crisp and sharp, not soft and diffused. Imagine a piece of paper on a desk with a single strong light source directly above — the shadow it casts has clean, defined edges. That's a hard shadow.

Technically: offset 8 pixels to the right, offset 8 pixels down, blur radius of 0, pure black (#000000).

In CSS terms: `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px #000;`

### Why We Use Hard Shadows

**They're distinctly modern.** Hard shadows were popularized by the neo-brutalist and modern design movements. When someone sees a hard shadow, they immediately register "this was designed intentionally by someone with a point of view." Soft, blurry shadows feel generic — like the default Photoshop drop shadow everyone used in 2012.

**They create visual pop.** In a social media feed full of photos, text posts, and soft-looking graphics, hard shadows make elements jump off the screen. They demand attention because they create stark contrast between the element and the background.

**They signal confidence.** Soft shadows are hedging — they're trying to create depth without committing to a direction. Hard shadows are decisive. They pick a direction (down and to the right) and commit to it fully. This confidence in design choices translates to perceived confidence in the content.

**They're memorable.** When all of JasAI's visual content uses the same hard shadow treatment, it becomes a recognizable signature. People start to identify the style before they even read the content.

### What to Avoid

**Soft, blurry shadows:** These feel dated, like a 2010-era website template. They also feel corporate and generic — like something generated by a tool rather than designed by a person.

**No shadows at all:** While possible, flat design without shadows can feel too simple for infographics where we want elements to have visual weight and hierarchy.

**Colored shadows:** Keep it simple. Pure black creates the most contrast and the cleanest look. Colored shadows can work in some contexts but feel too playful for our brand.

**Inconsistent shadows:** If one card has an 8px shadow and another has a 4px shadow, the design falls apart. Consistency is key.

### Analogy

Think about how Apple products have crisp, sharp edges — the iPhone, the MacBook, the iPad. They don't soften the corners into blobs. They commit to the geometric form. Our hard shadows are the visual equivalent — committing to a clear, sharp aesthetic choice.

## 6. Color Philosophy

### The Foundation: Warm Cream Background (#FAF3E3)

Every JasAI infographic starts with this background color. Not white. Not gray. Warm cream.

**Why warm cream instead of white?**

Pure white (#FFFFFF) is clinical. It's the color of a blank document, a sterile hospital room, an empty page waiting to be filled. It feels cold and impersonal.

Warm cream feels like quality paper. Think about premium business cards, expensive notebooks, or the pages of a well-made book. There's warmth there. It's inviting. It says "someone thought about this."

It also reduces eye strain for viewers scrolling through social media. White on screens can feel harsh; cream feels gentle.

**Why warm cream instead of any other color?**

Dark backgrounds feel intimidating and cold (more on this below). Bright colors would compete with our content. Gray feels corporate and lifeless. Cream is the perfect neutral that feels warm without being distracting.

### The Absolute Rule: NEVER Black Backgrounds

This is non-negotiable. Never use black (#000000) or dark gray as a background color.

**Why not?**

Black backgrounds feel:
- Cold and uninviting
- Intimidating and aggressive
- Tech-bro and startup-y in a bad way
- Corporate and impersonal

They also create accessibility issues — white text on black can cause halation (glowing effect) for many readers, and the high contrast is harder on the eyes for extended viewing.

Black backgrounds have their place in cinema, photography, and certain tech brands. They do NOT have a place in JasAI's warm, approachable, helpful brand.

If you ever feel tempted to use a dark background because it might look "sleek" or "modern," resist. Our brand is warm. We stay warm.

### The Accent Color Cycle

We have three accent colors that should be cycled through for visual variety:

1. **Green (#D2ECD0)** — Primary accent. Fresh, calm, growth-oriented.
2. **Dark Yellow (#FDEEC4)** — Tertiary accent. Warm, optimistic, energetic.
3. **Light Blue (#E5F5F9)** — Secondary for subtle backgrounds. Cool, trustworthy, clean.
4. **Red/Pink (#F3C1C0)** — Secondary accent. Gentle warmth, human touch.

**How to cycle:** When you have multiple elements (cards, boxes, sections), alternate through these colors. Card 1 might be green, Card 2 yellow, Card 3 blue. This creates visual rhythm and prevents monotony while staying on-brand.

**The feeling each color creates:**

- **Green** feels like growth, progress, positivity. Use it for tips, benefits, positive outcomes.
- **Yellow** feels warm, optimistic, attention-grabbing. Use it for highlights, key takeaways, energy.
- **Blue** feels calm, trustworthy, professional. Use it for data, facts, supporting information.
- **Pink** feels human, warm, approachable. Use it sparingly for emotional resonance.

### Color Usage Guidelines

| Use Case | Color Choice |
|----------|-------------|
| Main background | Warm cream (#FAF3E3) |
| Cards and containers | Accent colors (green, yellow, blue, pink) |
| Primary text | Dark (#020309) |
| Text on dark backgrounds | Light (#FAF3E3) |
| Shadows | Pure black (#000000) |
| Borders | Dark (#020309) |

## 7. Typography as Communication

### Why Font Choices Matter

Typography isn't just about making text readable — it communicates personality before anyone reads a single word. The shape of letters, the weight of strokes, the spacing between characters all create an immediate impression.

Imagine receiving two business cards. One uses Comic Sans. The other uses a clean, modern sans-serif. You immediately form different impressions of the people behind those cards — before reading their names or titles.

### Space Grotesk for Headings

Space Grotesk is our heading font. It's a geometric sans-serif with a modern, confident character.

**Why Space Grotesk?**

- **Modern and fresh:** Designed in 2018, it doesn't carry baggage from older design eras.
- **Geometric but friendly:** The letterforms are based on geometric shapes but softened slightly so they don't feel cold.
- **Distinctive:** It has enough character to be recognizable without being distracting.
- **Professional:** It's used by tech companies and designers who care about craft — it signals that we care too.

Use Space Grotesk for all headings, titles, and any text that's 24 points or larger.

### Montserrat for Body Text

Montserrat is our body text font. It's a clean, highly readable sans-serif that pairs well with Space Grotesk.

**Why Montserrat?**

- **Excellent readability:** Designed specifically for on-screen reading.
- **Friendly without being casual:** It has a warm, approachable quality while remaining professional.
- **Versatile:** Works well at many sizes and weights.
- **Free and widely available:** No licensing complications.

Use Montserrat for all body text, labels, captions, and supporting text.

### Typography Hierarchy

In any infographic, there must be a clear visual hierarchy:

1. **Title/Main Heading:** The biggest, boldest text. This is what people read first. If someone only reads one thing, it should be this.

2. **Section Headings/Labels:** Smaller than the title but still prominent. These help people navigate the content.

3. **Body Text:** The smallest. This is the supporting detail.

**The rule:** The title must dominate. If you squint at the infographic and the title doesn't stand out, make it bigger. The title should be impossible to miss.

### Word Limits

This is critical: **Infographics are not articles.**

| Element | Maximum Words |
|---------|--------------|
| Main title | 6 words |
| Section headings | 4 words |
| Labels | 3 words |
| Body text per section | 15 words |

**Why these limits?**

If you can't say it in 6 words, the concept isn't clear enough. Infographics communicate through visuals supported by minimal text. The text should be like road signs — scannable in a split second.

When you're tempted to add more words, ask yourself: "Can this be said with fewer words?" Almost always, yes.

### The 2-Second Test (Apply BEFORE Designing)

**CRITICAL:** The 2-second test is not a post-production quality check. It's a pre-design validation tool. Apply it BEFORE writing any prompt, not after generating an image.

Before designing, answer this question: "A person scrolling LinkedIn sees this image for exactly 2 seconds. What do they GET?"

Write the answer in one sentence:

**For Editorial Illustration:** "They feel [specific emotion] and stop scrolling because [specific reason]."
Example: "They feel a jolt of recognition — they've been in both rooms — and stop because the image names something they've been living but couldn't articulate."

**For Information Graphic:** "They learn [specific fact] and think 'I should save this.'"
Example: "They learn that domain experts have 6 advantages over developers in the AI era, and think 'I should save this comparison.'"

**If you can't write this sentence clearly, the concept isn't ready.** Go back and refine the concept before touching any prompt.

After generation, the 2-second test becomes a validation check. If the generated image doesn't deliver the promised 2-second hit, the concept may need rethinking (not just editing).

---

## 8. The Art of Restraint

### Why Less Is More

The biggest mistake in infographic design is trying to fit too much. When everything is important, nothing is important. When every concept is included, none of them land.

Think about a highway billboard. You pass it at 65 mph. The best billboards have maybe 7 words and one image. The worst billboards cram in three phone numbers, two logos, a tagline, and a wall of text nobody can read.

Social media posts are like billboards. People are scrolling fast. Your infographic has maybe 2 seconds to make an impression. Restraint is how you make those seconds count.

### The "One Key Message" Rule

Every infographic should communicate exactly ONE key message. Not two. Not three. One.

This doesn't mean one piece of information — it means one takeaway that sticks in the viewer's mind. All the visual elements, all the supporting text, all the design choices should reinforce that single message.

**How to identify your one key message:**

1. Write down everything the content covers.
2. Ask: "If the viewer remembers only ONE thing, what should it be?"
3. That's your key message. Everything else is supporting material.

If you find yourself thinking "but this AND this are both important," you probably need two infographics, not one overloaded one.

### What to Cut

When you're designing, look at every element and ask: "Does this help communicate the key message?"

If the answer is "not really" or "sort of" or "it adds context" — cut it.

Be ruthless. Every element that doesn't directly support the message is noise that dilutes the signal. A viewer's attention is finite. Don't waste it on tangential information.

**Common things to cut:**
- Detailed explanations (save for the post caption)
- Multiple examples (pick the best one)
- Caveats and qualifications (mention in caption if needed)
- Decorative elements that don't serve the message
- Logos and attribution (footer only)

### White Space Is a Design Element

Empty space is not wasted space. White space (or in our case, cream space) is a critical design element.

White space:
- **Creates focus:** By surrounding important elements with space, you direct attention to them.
- **Improves readability:** Text with room to breathe is easier to read than cramped text.
- **Signals quality:** Premium brands use generous white space. Cramped designs feel cheap.
- **Reduces cognitive load:** Fewer elements means less for the brain to process.

When you look at your design, ask: "Is there room to breathe?" If elements feel crowded, remove something rather than shrinking everything.

### Density Limits

**Never more than 4-5 distinct elements** in an infographic.

A "distinct element" is a major visual component: a card, a chart, an icon, a text block. If you count up your major elements and it's 6, 7, 8 or more, the design is too complex.

This is a hard rule. If you have 7 tips to share, you need to either:
1. Pick the top 4-5 best tips
2. Create a series of infographics (Part 1, Part 2)
3. Find a way to group them (e.g., 3 tips in one card, 2 in another = 2 elements)

### The Squint Test

Here's a practical exercise: squint at your design until everything goes blurry.

Can you still see clear structure? Is there an obvious focal point? Can you tell where different sections begin and end?

If the design looks like an undifferentiated blob when you squint, it needs more visual structure. If one area looks like a dark clump of stuff, it's too dense.

The squint test reveals whether your hierarchy is working. After squinting, you should be able to point at the design and say "that's the main thing, those are the supporting things, and that's the footer."

---

## 9. Layout Thinking

When designing an infographic, the first decision is: what visual structure fits this content? Here are the main archetypes and when to use each.

### Card Grid Layout

**When to use:** Multiple items of equal importance that don't have a sequential relationship. Tips, features, benefits, examples.

**Why it works:** Card grids are scannable. Viewers can look at any card first and get value. The grid structure feels organized and professional — familiar from web design.

**How to execute:**
- Maximum 4 cards (2x2 grid or 1x4 row)
- All cards should be the same size for visual balance
- Each card needs a clear hierarchy: title/number, brief text, maybe an icon
- Cycle accent colors: Card 1 green, Card 2 yellow, Card 3 blue, Card 4 pink
- Equal spacing between cards — generous, not cramped
- Hard shadows on every card

**Example content:** "4 Ways to Use AI in Your Business" — each way is one card.

### Single Hero Layout

**When to use:** One powerful concept, visual metaphor, or central idea that deserves full attention.

**Why it works:** A single focal point creates maximum impact. No competition for attention. The image does the communicating; text supports it.

**How to execute:**
- One large central visual (icon, illustration, or diagram)
- Minimal text: title above, 1-2 sentence explanation below
- The visual should be metaphorical or conceptual — not just decorative
- Generous space around the visual so it breathes
- Let the image speak; resist adding labels everywhere

**Example content:** "The Compound Effect of Daily Learning" — show a snowball growing.

### Vertical Flow Layout

**When to use:** Sequential processes, steps, timelines, or anything with a natural order.

**Why it works:** Top-to-bottom reading is natural in Western cultures. The vertical flow implies progression and order — "do this, then this, then this."

**How to execute:**
- Clear numbering (1, 2, 3) or visual connectors between steps
- Each step gets its own container/card
- Visual connection between steps (line, arrow, or aligned edges)
- Title at top explaining what the process achieves
- Consistent spacing between steps

**Example content:** "3 Steps to Automate Your Inbox" — each step is a row.

### Comparison Layout

**When to use:** Before/after, this vs. that, good vs. bad, Option A vs. Option B.

**Why it works:** Juxtaposition creates instant understanding. Putting two things side by side invites comparison. The viewer "gets it" without needing explanation.

**How to execute:**
- Equal visual weight on both sides — symmetry is important
- Clear visual or text divider in the middle
- Labels that make the comparison obvious ("Before / After", "Old Way / New Way")
- Color coding can help (e.g., muted colors for "old," vibrant for "new")
- The "better" side should be slightly more visually appealing (brighter, cleaner)

**Example content:** "Manual Process vs. Automated Workflow" — show the time/effort difference.

### Hierarchy Layout (Pyramid / Iceberg / Layers)

**When to use:** Showing levels of importance, hidden depth, foundational concepts, or layers of meaning.

**Why it works:** Visual metaphors like pyramids and icebergs are universally understood. They map directly to mental models people already have.

**How to execute:**
- Choose the right metaphor:
  - **Pyramid:** Foundation at bottom, peak achievement at top
  - **Iceberg:** Visible surface vs. hidden depth below
  - **Layers:** Equal importance but different depths
- Label each level clearly
- Size indicates importance or visibility
- Color can distinguish layers (darker = deeper, lighter = surface)

**Example content:** "What People See vs. What It Takes" — iceberg with visible success above, invisible effort below.

### Funnel Layout

**When to use:** Processes that narrow down, conversion flows, decision trees that eliminate options.

**Why it works:** The funnel shape instantly communicates "many become few" or "broad becomes focused."

**How to execute:**
- Wide at top, narrow at bottom
- Each stage labeled clearly
- Consider showing numbers if relevant (1000 → 100 → 10)
- Color can intensify as funnel narrows (showing concentration)

**Example content:** "Lead to Customer Journey" — show stages of narrowing.

## 10. Quality Evaluation

Before finalizing any infographic, run it through these self-checks. Think of this as quality assurance for design.

### The 2-Second Test (Post-Generation Validation)

You should have already applied the 2-second test BEFORE designing (see Section 7: Typography). At this stage, you're validating that the generated image delivers the promised hit.

Look at the generated image and ask: **"Does it deliver what I promised in the pre-design 2-second statement?"**

If yes: proceed to fine-tuning edits.

If no: ask the DIAGNOSTIC question — "Is the concept wrong, or is the execution wrong?"

- **Concept wrong** (the scene/data doesn't communicate the right thing): Go back to visualization design. Do NOT iterate on a broken concept.
- **Execution wrong** (the right idea but the rendering doesn't land): Iterate with edits. Adjust the prompt, change visual elements, refine the composition.

This distinction prevents the most common iteration trap: spending 5+ rounds polishing a visual that was never going to work because the underlying concept doesn't transmit in 2 seconds.

### The Squint Test

Blur your vision or squint at the design. You should still see:

1. **Clear structure:** Distinct regions or sections
2. **A focal point:** One area that draws the eye
3. **Breathing room:** Space between major elements
4. **Hierarchy:** Some elements obviously more prominent than others

If the design looks like a blob of stuff when you squint, it's too cluttered. If everything blends together, there's no hierarchy. If there's no obvious focal point, nothing will grab attention.

**How to fix:**
- Increase spacing between elements
- Make the main element significantly larger than supporting elements
- Remove one element (the one that contributes least)
- Adjust colors so primary and secondary elements are more distinct

### The So-What Test

Look at each element in the design and ask: "Does this help communicate the key message?"

Go through systematically:
- The title: Does it state or support the key message?
- Each card/section: Does it directly relate to the key message?
- Each piece of text: Does it advance understanding?
- Each visual element: Does it clarify or just decorate?

If the answer is "not really," remove it. Every element must earn its place by serving the message.

**How to fix:**
- Cut any element that fails the test
- Replace decorative elements with meaningful ones
- Consolidate similar elements to reduce count
- Ask "would this be clearer without this?" for each element

### The Brand Gut Check

This is the subjective check. Look at the infographic and ask:

1. **Does this feel like it belongs on the JasAI website?** There should be visual consistency — warm colors, clean layout, hard shadows.

2. **Is it warm, clean, and confident?** Not cold. Not cluttered. Not tentative.

3. **Would Ben proudly share this?** It should feel personal and quality, not template-generated.

4. **Does it feel like advice from a knowledgeable friend?** Not corporate content. Not trying too hard. Just helpful.

Trust your instincts on this. If something feels "off," it probably is. The gut check catches things the other tests might miss.

## 11. Common Mistakes

Understanding what goes wrong helps you avoid those traps. Here are the most common mistakes and how to fix them.

### The Text Dump

**What it looks like:** An infographic that's really just a lot of text arranged in a shape. Paragraphs crammed into boxes. Multiple sentences per section. The viewer has to read, not scan.

**Why it happens:** The creator tried to fit an entire article or all the nuance of a topic into one image. They didn't commit to one key message.

**The fix:** Pick ONE insight from the content. Just one. The most interesting, most shareable, most useful single thing. Visualize that. The rest can go in the post caption, a carousel, or nowhere.

**Remember:** If it's a text dump, it's not an infographic. It's just an image of text. That defeats the purpose.

### The Rainbow Explosion

**What it looks like:** Every element is a different color. There are colors that aren't in the brand palette. The design feels chaotic and overwhelming.

**Why it happens:** The creator thought the design looked "boring" with limited colors and added more to make it "interesting." Or they used colors to differentiate every single element.

**The fix:** Stick to the accent color cycle (green, yellow, blue, pink) plus the background cream and text dark. If you feel like you need more colors, you probably have too many elements. Reduce complexity instead of adding colors.

**Remember:** Restraint in color creates sophistication. More colors = more chaos.

### The Template Trap

**What it looks like:** The design has decoration for decoration's sake. Borders within borders. Gradient backgrounds. Decorative shapes in corners. Multiple font styles. Drop shadows AND borders AND gradients.

**Why it happens:** The creator wanted it to look "designed" and kept adding embellishments. Or they copied elements from different templates that don't go together.

**The fix:** Decoration is not design. Strip away anything that doesn't serve the message. Our brand is defined by what we don't include as much as what we do. Clean, simple, purposeful.

**Remember:** If you removed an element and the message is still clear, the element wasn't needed.

### The Black Hole

**What it looks like:** Dark gray or black background with light text. Feels like a tech startup pitch deck or a movie poster.

**Why it happens:** The creator thought dark backgrounds look "sleek" or "professional" or "modern." Dark mode is popular.

**The fix:** Always warm cream (#FAF3E3). No exceptions. Dark backgrounds are fundamentally at odds with our warm, approachable brand. They feel cold and intimidating.

**Remember:** We are warm. We stay warm.

### The Kitchen Sink

**What it looks like:** The infographic tries to cover everything. Multiple concepts. Every supporting point. All the exceptions and caveats. The result is overwhelming and nothing stands out.

**Why it happens:** The creator didn't want to leave anything out. They felt everything was important.

**The fix:** Embrace focus. Pick one thing. Make one infographic that does one thing well. If there's more to say, make another infographic. A series of focused infographics is infinitely better than one overloaded one.

**Remember:** When everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.

### The Floating Elements

**What it looks like:** Elements are scattered around without clear alignment or visual connection. Things feel randomly placed rather than intentionally arranged.

**Why it happens:** Elements were added one at a time without considering the overall composition. No grid structure was established.

**The fix:** Establish alignment. Use a grid, even a simple one. Elements should relate to each other visually — aligned edges, consistent spacing, grouped by relevance. The viewer's eye should flow naturally from one element to the next.

**Remember:** Every element's position should feel intentional, not accidental.

## 12. Platform Context

Different platforms have different requirements and user behaviors. Here's how to adapt.

### LinkedIn (Primary Platform)

**User behavior:** LinkedIn users scroll fast, often on mobile during commutes or breaks. The feed is dominated by text posts and shared articles. Visual content stands out but must earn attention quickly.

**Format:** 4:5 portrait aspect ratio. This takes up more vertical screen space, making your content harder to scroll past. At approximately 2048 pixels wide for high quality.

**Design implications:**
- The title needs to be huge and readable on mobile
- The visual should stop the scroll — bold, clear, intriguing
- Less text is more — LinkedIn audiences are skimming, not studying
- Hard shadows and bold colors help stand out against the gray/white of the feed
- The content should be valuable on its own, not just a teaser

**What works:** Tips, frameworks, contrarian takes, surprising data, how-tos. Content that makes people think "I should save this."

**What doesn't work:** Generic motivational quotes (too common), text dumps (hard to read), purely promotional content (people scroll past).

### Instagram

**User behavior:** More visual-first than LinkedIn. Users expect polished, aesthetic content. Saves and shares happen when content is reference-worthy.

**Format:** 1:1 square for feed consistency, or 4:5 for more real estate. Instagram favors visual impact over information density.

**Design implications:**
- Even more minimal text — let visuals dominate
- Higher emphasis on aesthetic polish
- Consider how it looks in a grid (consistent style across posts)
- Make it worth saving — reference-worthy, beautiful, or both
- Simpler concepts work better than complex frameworks

**What works:** Clean visuals, single concepts, beautiful typography, striking color use.

**What doesn't work:** Dense information, text-heavy designs, complex diagrams.

### Twitter/X

**User behavior:** Ultra-fast scrolling. Very short attention spans. Images need to work as thumbnails in the timeline.

**Format:** 16:9 landscape works best in the timeline. Simpler is better — designs need to read at small sizes.

**Design implications:**
- The simplest possible design
- Maybe just a title and one visual element
- Very large, readable text
- Maximum contrast
- Must work as a thumbnail

### Presentations

**Format:** 16:9 landscape for slides. Higher information density acceptable because viewers have more time with each slide.

**Design implications:**
- Can include more detail than social media infographics
- Speaker will provide context, so visual can be supportive
- Still maintain brand consistency (colors, shadows, typography)
- Make sure it's readable from the back of a room

## 13. Prompt Engineering for Image Generation

When you craft prompts for Gemini image generation, you're not just listing specifications — you're teaching the AI to understand the feeling and intent of our brand. Here's how to write effective prompts.

### Lead with Feeling, End with Specs

Don't start with technical requirements. Start by describing the aesthetic you want. The AI responds better to evocative descriptions than to spec lists.

**Good structure:**
1. Describe the overall feeling and style
2. Describe the content and layout
3. List specific brand requirements
4. End with technical specs

### Key Phrases to Include

These phrases help Gemini understand our aesthetic:

**For the overall feel:**
- "Clean, minimal composition with generous white space"
- "Modern, confident aesthetic — like a premium tech brand"
- "Warm and approachable, not cold or corporate"
- "Professional but friendly, like a well-designed coffee shop"
- "Intentional, thoughtful design — every element has purpose"

**For the visual style:**
- "Bold hard shadows that make elements pop — 8px offset, 0 blur, pure black"
- "Crisp, sharp edges — not soft or blurry"
- "Solid 2px borders around cards and containers"
- "Slightly rounded corners — not fully round, just softened"
- "One clear focal point that draws the eye"

**For colors:**
- "Warm cream background (#FAF3E3) — like quality paper"
- "NEVER dark or black backgrounds"
- "Accent colors cycling through soft green (#D2ECD0), warm yellow (#FDEEC4), light blue (#E5F5F9)"
- "Dark text (#020309) for readability"

### Example Prompt Structure

Here's how a complete prompt should flow:

```
Create a clean, modern infographic with a warm, approachable aesthetic. The design should feel like something from a premium tech brand — confident and intentional, not cluttered or corporate.

[CONTENT DESCRIPTION]
Title: "[Exact title text]"
Layout: [Describe the chosen structure — e.g., "4 cards in a 2x2 grid"]
Content per section: [List exact text for each section]

[STYLE REQUIREMENTS]
- Warm cream background (#FAF3E3) — like quality paper, NEVER black or dark
- Bold hard shadows on all cards: 8px right, 8px down, 0 blur, pure black (#000)
- Solid 2px dark borders (#020309) around cards
- Slightly rounded corners on cards — not fully round, just softened
- Accent colors: green (#D2ECD0), yellow (#FDEEC4), blue (#E5F5F9), pink (#F3C1C0) — cycle through for cards
- Typography: Bold modern sans-serif for headings, clean readable sans for body

[TECHNICAL SPECS]
- Output as a 4:5 portrait aspect ratio image at approximately 2048 pixels wide
- Footer text: "Jaspreet Singh | Founder @ VividAutomate"
```

### What Makes Prompts Fail

**Too vague:** "Make a nice infographic about AI" — no content specifics, no style guidance.

**Too technical without context:** "Use #FAF3E3 background, 8px 8px 0 shadow, 2px border" — specs without feeling.

**Contradictory instructions:** "Minimal design with lots of detailed information" — the AI can't satisfy both.

**Missing content:** Describing style but not specifying the actual text and layout.

### Iteration Prompts

When editing an existing image, be specific about what to change and what to keep:

```
Edit this infographic:
1. Make the title 30% larger for better visibility
2. Change the third card's background from green to yellow
3. Reduce the body text in each card to 8 words maximum

Keep everything else exactly the same — the shadows, borders, overall layout, and other text should remain unchanged.
```

## 14. Prompt Vector Reference

Prompt vectors are specific phrases that reliably control output quality in image generation. They're not magic words — they're precise instructions that give the AI model clear targets for specific dimensions of the output.

### Emotional Register Vectors

These control how the image FEELS:

| Register | Prompt Vector | When to Use |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Quiet / contemplative | "The emotional register is quiet — this image doesn't shout, it sits with you. Contemplative, like the last page of a book." | Reflective essays, existential truths, inner experiences |
| Bold / punchy | "Bold, confident, demands attention — designed to stop the scroll. High contrast, decisive composition." | Strong claims, challenges to convention, calls to action |
| Raw / honest | "Unflinching, direct, no decoration — like a photograph of truth. The vulnerability is the strength." | Personal confessions, hard truths, unfiltered experiences |
| Warm / human | "Warm, imperfect, feels made by human hands — analog warmth, gentle light, the comfort of the familiar." | Community-focused content, mentorship, personal stories |
| Surreal / dreamlike | "Dreamlike spatial distortion — rooms feel emotionally true rather than physically accurate. Objects exist because they carry meaning, not because they make architectural sense." | Emotional claims that are felt rather than observed |

### Density Vectors

These control information density and whitespace:

| Level | Prompt Vector | When to Use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Minimal | "Minimal composition, generous whitespace, every element earns its place through necessity. Empty space is a design element, not wasted space." | Editorial illustrations, single-concept visuals |
| Moderate | "Structured layout with breathing room between every element. Premium magazine spread density — organized but never cramped." | Information graphics with 3-5 elements |
| Dense | **AVOID for social media.** "Dense information display" → leads to cramped, unreadable output. If you have this much data, make a carousel. | Never for single social media images |

### Materiality Vectors

These control the physical texture and feel:

| Material | Prompt Vector | Effect |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Paper | "Subtle paper grain texture like quality stock. Feels printed on premium paper, not rendered digitally." | Adds warmth and tactile quality. Makes digital feel physical. |
| Ink | "Confident ink linework, like it was drawn with a technical pen by a steady hand. Line weight varies with intention." | Creates hand-drawn authority. Feels crafted, not generated. |
| Print | "Like risograph printing — slight imperfections in registration, tactile analog warmth, the human fingerprint of mechanical reproduction." | Adds authenticity and imperfection. Anti-digital aesthetic. |
| Canvas | "Textured like canvas or heavy watercolor paper. Visible surface grain. The medium is part of the message." | Adds weight and permanence. Art gallery feel. |

### Spatial Vectors

These control spatial relationships and composition:

| Spatial Effect | Prompt Vector | When to Use |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Surreal distortion | "Surreal spatial distortion — rooms and spaces feel dreamlike, not photorealistic. Architecture serves emotional truth, not physics." | Editorial illustrations about internal experiences |
| Stylized figures | "Figures are stylized but human — not cartoonish, not hyperreal, universal. You should see yourself in them, not a specific person." | Any scene with human figures |
| Disproportionate scale | "Disproportionate scale to emphasize emotional weight — the thing that matters most is physically largest, regardless of real-world size." | Emphasizing power dynamics, importance hierarchies |
| Cinematic framing | "Cinematic composition — the image is a still from a film that doesn't exist. Clear focal point, intentional depth, directional light." | Any scene-based editorial illustration |
| Clean data space | "Clean, organized spatial layout. Grid-aligned elements. Every pixel has purpose. White background feels expansive, not empty." | Information graphics, scorecards, checklists |

### Negative Vectors (What NOT to Do)

Always include explicit negatives. These prevent the AI from falling into common traps:

| Avoid | Prompt Vector |
|-------|--------------|
| Cartoonish | "Not cartoonish, not anime, not clipart. Stylized but grounded in emotional reality." |
| Hyperreal | "Not photorealistic, not 3D rendered, not stock photo aesthetic." |
| Corporate | "Not corporate, not clip art, not template-generated. This was made by a person with a point of view." |
| Dark backgrounds | "NO black backgrounds, NO dark gray backgrounds, NO dark mode aesthetic. Everything warm and light." |
| Overdecorated | "No decorative elements that don't serve the message. No borders within borders, no gradients for gradient's sake." |

### Combining Vectors

A well-constructed prompt combines vectors from multiple dimensions. Example for an editorial illustration:

```
Emotional: "The emotional register is quiet — contemplative, like the last page of a book."
Spatial: "Surreal spatial distortion — rooms feel emotionally true, not physically accurate."
Materiality: "Subtle paper grain texture like quality stock. Confident ink linework."
Density: "Minimal composition, generous whitespace, every element earns its place."
Figures: "Figures are stylized but human — universal, not specific."
Negative: "Not cartoonish, not hyperreal, not corporate. No black backgrounds."
```

These vectors work together to create a coherent visual world. Don't just pick one from each category — select the ones that serve your specific content's needs.

## Summary: The Quick Reference

When you're in the flow of designing, here are the essentials:

### Before Everything: Content Analysis
- Extract meaning at all 4 layers: Narrative → Themes → Claims → Information
- Visualize Layer 3 (Claims) for editorial illustrations
- Visualize Layer 4 (Information) for information graphics
- Never default to Layer 1 (Narrative) or Layer 2 (Themes)
- Ask: "What should the viewer KNOW or FEEL after 2 seconds?"

### Output Mode
- **Editorial Illustration:** Viewer should FEEL. Scenes, not layouts. Discover style from content.
- **Information Graphic:** Viewer should LEARN. Scorecards, charts, checklists. JasAI brand system.
- **Decide the mode BEFORE designing.** Never mix them up.

### The 2-Second Test (Pre-Design)
- Write ONE sentence: what the viewer GETS in 2 seconds
- If you can't write it, the concept isn't ready
- Apply BEFORE writing any prompt, not after generating

### Brand Feeling (Information Graphics)
- Warm, clean, confident, approachable
- "Like a well-designed coffee shop" — premium but welcoming
- Apple keynote energy — bold, minimal, intentional

### Style Discovery (Editorial Illustrations)
- Use style anchors: specific artists, movements, aesthetic traditions
- "Moebius meets Adult Swim" beats "clean modern illustration"
- Match content tone to visual world
- Let the user's taste guide the direction

### Visual Rules (Information Graphics)
- Background: Warm cream (#FAF3E3) — NEVER black
- Shadows: Hard shadows only (8px, 8px, 0px, #000)
- Borders: Solid 2px, slightly rounded corners
- Colors: Cycle through green, yellow, blue, pink accents
- Fonts: Space Grotesk for headings, Montserrat for body

### Content Rules
- ONE key message per infographic
- Maximum 6 words in title
- Maximum 4-5 distinct elements
- Every element must earn its place

### Quality Checks
- 2-second test: Does it deliver the promised hit?
- Diagnostic question: Is it the concept or the execution?
- Squint test: Is structure clear when blurred?
- So-what test: Does every element serve the message?
- Brand gut check: Does it feel like JasAI? (info graphics only)

### Prompt Vectors
- Emotional register: quiet/bold/raw/warm/surreal
- Density: minimal/moderate (never dense for social)
- Materiality: paper/ink/print/canvas
- Spatial: surreal distortion/stylized figures/cinematic framing
- Always include negative vectors (what NOT to do)

### Footer
Always: "Jaspreet Singh | Founder @ VividAutomate"

*These principles should inform every design decision. The quality of the output is determined by the quality of the thinking BEFORE any prompt is written. Spend 70% of the effort understanding what to visualize and 30% on how to visualize it. When in doubt, choose clarity over cleverness, warmth over coolness, and restraint over abundance.*
