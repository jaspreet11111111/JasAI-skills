# Nano Banana MCP Image Generation Reference

Technical reference for generating and editing infographic images using the Nano Banana MCP tools.

---

## Overview

Image generation and editing is handled through the Nano Banana MCP server (`@zhibinyang/nano-banana-mcp`), which exposes 6 tools. The MCP server is auto-configured via the plugin system — no manual setup required beyond having a Gemini API key.

**Underlying models:**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`) — Default. Fast generation, optimized for high-volume tasks
- **Gemini 3 Pro Image** (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview`) — Highest quality, up to 4K resolution

**Note:** This package was updated (Feb 2026) to use current, stable Gemini models instead of the deprecated `-preview` variants.

## Available MCP Tools

### 1. `generate_image`

Creates a new image from a text prompt.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Detailed text description of the image to create |

**Returns:** Image preview + file path where the image was saved (in `./generated_imgs/`)

**Usage:**

```
Call tool: generate_image
Parameters: { "prompt": "Your detailed infographic prompt here" }
```

**TIP:** This tool accepts optional `aspectRatio` and `imageSize` parameters. For best results, pass `aspectRatio` as a parameter AND embed the specs in the prompt text:
- Parameter: `"aspectRatio": "4:5"` + prompt: "...Output as a 4:5 portrait aspect ratio image at approximately 2048 pixels wide"
- Parameter: `"aspectRatio": "16:9"` + prompt: "...Output as a 16:9 landscape image at 4K resolution"

---

### 2. `edit_image`

Modifies an existing image based on text instructions.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `imagePath` | string | Yes | Path to the image to edit |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Edit instructions |
| `referenceImages` | string[] | No | Paths to reference images for style guidance |

**Returns:** Edited image preview + file path

**Usage:**

```
Call tool: edit_image
Parameters: {
  "imagePath": ".infographic/images/topic-v1.png",
  "prompt": "Make the title text larger and change the blue to purple #7C3AED"
}
```

---

### 3. `continue_editing`

Applies further edits to the most recently processed image without specifying a path.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Further modifications to apply |
| `referenceImages` | string[] | No | Paths to reference images |

**Returns:** Updated image preview + file path

**Usage:**

```
Call tool: continue_editing
Parameters: { "prompt": "Add more whitespace around the title" }
```

**When to use:** After an initial `edit_image` call, use `continue_editing` for all subsequent iterations in the same session. This maintains editing context.

---

### 4. `get_last_image_info`

Retrieves metadata about the most recently created or edited image.

**Parameters:** None

**Returns:** File path, size, modification time of the last image

---

### 5. `configure_gemini_token`

**⚠️ DO NOT USE - Creates unwanted `.nano-banana-config.json` file**

This tool saves the API key to a separate JSON file instead of using the centralized `.env` approach. We want ALL API keys in one `.env` file, not scattered across multiple config files.

**Instead:** Save the key to `.env` and restart Claude Code (see Phase 4 in skill.md).

**Why avoid this:**
- Creates `.nano-banana-config.json` in the project
- Doesn't work with the centralized `.env` pattern
- Requires tracking multiple config files for different MCP servers

**Deprecated usage (DO NOT USE):**
```
Call tool: configure_gemini_token
Parameters: { "apiKey": "AIzaSy..." }
```

---

### 6. `get_configuration_status`

**⚠️ DO NOT USE - Known to give false positives**

This tool reports the key as "configured" even when it's not valid or doesn't exist. Always check the environment variable directly instead:

```bash
if [ -n "$GEMINI_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "Key is set"
else
  echo "Key not set"
fi
```

---

## File Handling

### MCP Output Location

The MCP server saves images to `./generated_imgs/` (in the current project directory) with timestamped names:
- Generated: `generated-[timestamp]-[id].png`
- Edited: `edited-[timestamp]-[id].png`

**Note:** The MCP server uses the current working directory by default. Images are saved locally to the project, not to your Desktop.

### Copy to Project Directory

After every generation or edit, copy the output to the canonical project directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .infographic/images
cp "./generated_imgs/[returned-filename]" ".infographic/images/[topic-slug]-v[N].png"
```

### File Naming Convention

| Stage | Pattern | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| First version | `[topic]-v1.png` | `success-iceberg-v1.png` |
| After edits | `[topic]-v2.png` | `success-iceberg-v2.png` |
| Final approved | `[topic]-final.png` | `success-iceberg-final.png` |
| Series | `[topic]-01-v1.png` | `productivity-tips-01-v1.png` |

### CRITICAL: Always Display to User

After saving, **immediately use the Read tool** to show the image:

```
Read the file: .infographic/images/topic-v1.png
```

This allows the user to SEE the image and provide feedback for edits.

---

## Embedding Image Specifications in Prompts

Since the MCP tool does not have separate parameters for aspect ratio and resolution, these must be embedded in the prompt text.

### Aspect Ratio

| Platform | Prompt Suffix |
|----------|---------------|
| LinkedIn | "Output as a 4:5 portrait aspect ratio image" |
| Square (Instagram) | "Output as a 1:1 square aspect ratio image" |
| Twitter/Presentation | "Output as a 16:9 landscape aspect ratio image" |
| Stories | "Output as a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio image" |

### Resolution

| Quality Level | Prompt Suffix |
|---------------|---------------|
| Standard | "at approximately 1024 pixels wide" |
| 2K (Recommended) | "at approximately 2048 pixels wide" |
| 4K | "at approximately 4096 pixels wide" |

### Combined Example

```
... [rest of prompt]. Output as a 4:5 portrait aspect ratio image at approximately 2048 pixels wide.
```

---

## Complete Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Generate

```
Call tool: generate_image
Parameters: { "prompt": "[full prompt with embedded aspect ratio and resolution]" }
```

### Step 2: Copy to Project Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .infographic/images
cp "./generated_imgs/[returned-filename]" ".infographic/images/[topic-slug]-v1.png"
```

### Step 3: Display to User

```
Read the file: .infographic/images/[topic-slug]-v1.png
```

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
ls -la .infographic/images/[topic-slug]-v1.png
```

---

## Editing Workflow

### First Edit

```
Call tool: edit_image
Parameters: {
  "imagePath": ".infographic/images/topic-v1.png",
  "prompt": "Edit instructions: 1. Make colors warmer 2. Increase title size"
}
```

Then copy and display:
```bash
cp "./generated_imgs/[returned-filename]" ".infographic/images/topic-v2.png"
```

### Subsequent Edits

```
Call tool: continue_editing
Parameters: { "prompt": "Add more whitespace, simplify the bottom section" }
```

Then copy and display:
```bash
cp "./generated_imgs/[returned-filename]" ".infographic/images/topic-v3.png"
```

### When to Edit vs Regenerate

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Color adjustments | `edit_image` / `continue_editing` |
| Text changes | `edit_image` / `continue_editing` |
| Layout tweaks | `edit_image` / `continue_editing` |
| Different metaphor | Regenerate with `generate_image` |
| Major concept change | Regenerate with `generate_image` |
| 50%+ of image needs change | Regenerate with `generate_image` |

## Prompt Vector Quick Reference

When constructing prompts for the MCP tools, use these specific phrases (prompt vectors) to control output quality. For the full reference with examples and context, see `design-principles.md` Section 14.

### Emotional Register

| Register | Embed in Prompt |
|----------|----------------|
| Quiet | "The emotional register is quiet — this image doesn't shout, it sits with you" |
| Bold | "Bold, confident, demands attention — designed to stop the scroll" |
| Raw | "Unflinching, direct, no decoration — like a photograph of truth" |
| Warm | "Warm, imperfect, feels made by human hands — analog warmth" |
| Surreal | "Dreamlike spatial distortion — emotionally true rather than physically accurate" |

### Density Control

| Level | Embed in Prompt |
|-------|----------------|
| Minimal | "Minimal composition, generous whitespace, every element earns its place" |
| Moderate | "Structured layout with breathing room. Premium magazine spread density" |
| Dense | **NEVER USE for social media.** Make a carousel instead. |

### Materiality

| Feel | Embed in Prompt |
|------|----------------|
| Paper | "Subtle paper grain texture like quality stock, feels printed not digital" |
| Ink | "Confident ink linework, like drawn with a technical pen" |
| Print | "Like risograph printing — slight imperfections, tactile, analog warmth" |

### Spatial Composition

| Effect | Embed in Prompt |
|--------|----------------|
| Surreal space | "Surreal spatial distortion — rooms feel dreamlike, not photorealistic" |
| Stylized figures | "Figures are stylized but human — not cartoonish, not hyperreal, universal" |
| Scale emphasis | "Disproportionate scale to emphasize emotional weight" |
| Cinematic | "Cinematic composition — a still from a film that doesn't exist" |

### Style Anchors (Editorial Illustration Only)

| Style | Embed in Prompt |
|-------|----------------|
| European editorial | "Moebius linework, vintage French magazine illustration, quiet existential surrealism" |
| Adult Swim | "[as] bumps aesthetic, quiet existential, surreal mundane" |
| Risograph | "Risograph printing, paper grain, muted analog palette, imperfect registration" |
| Minimalist conceptual | "Single powerful concept, editorial illustration, New Yorker cover energy" |
| Graphic novel | "Bold confident linework, Hergé clear line style, sequential framing" |

### Negative Vectors (Always Include)

| Avoid | Embed in Prompt |
|-------|----------------|
| Cartoonish | "Not cartoonish, not anime, not clipart" |
| Hyperreal | "Not photorealistic, not 3D rendered, not stock photo" |
| Corporate | "Not corporate, not template-generated" |
| Dark backgrounds | "NO black backgrounds, NO dark gray. Everything warm and light." |

### Example: Combining Vectors in a Prompt

```
A 4:5 portrait editorial illustration in the style of Moebius linework
meets Adult Swim interstitial aesthetic.

The emotional register is quiet — this image doesn't shout, it sits with you.

[SCENE DESCRIPTION HERE]

Figures are stylized but human — not cartoonish, not hyperreal, universal.
Surreal spatial distortion — rooms feel emotionally true, not physically accurate.
Subtle paper grain texture like quality stock. Confident ink linework.
Minimal composition, generous whitespace.

Dusty warm tones — cream, muted ochre, soft sage, warm gray.
NO black backgrounds. Everything warm and analog.
Not cartoonish, not hyperreal, not corporate.

Footer: "Jaspreet Singh | Founder @ JasAI"
Output at approximately 2048 pixels wide.

## Error Handling

### MCP Tool Not Available

If the Nano Banana MCP tools are not available (MCP server not running or not configured in plugin):
- Fall back to the "Skip for now" path
- Save the prompt to `.infographic/prompts/` for manual use
- Direct user to Google AI Studio

### API Key Not Configured

If the environment variable check shows no key:
- Run Phase 4 of the skill to get the key from the user
- Save to `.env` and restart Claude Code
- Or follow the "Skip for now" path

### Generation Fails

If `generate_image` returns an error about invalid API key:
- Check if `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set: `echo $GEMINI_API_KEY`
- If not set, run Phase 4 to configure it
- If set but invalid, get a new key from Google AI Studio
- Fall back to saving prompt for manual use

If generation fails for other reasons:
- Try simplifying the prompt
- If the prompt was flagged for safety, rephrase and avoid sensitive terms
- Check API quotas at console.cloud.google.com

### Rate Limit

If you hit a 429 rate limit:
- Wait 60 seconds and try again
- Or use the skip path for manual generation
